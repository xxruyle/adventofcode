look at the example input
the second range is (55-68)
where does that map into the next one
its within the (50-98) range which maps to 52
so (55-68) -> (57-70)
now look at the next one
its not inside any of them so (57-70) -> (57-70)
now look at the next one
part of it is inside (53-61) which maps to 49 and part of it is not
split the part which is inside it (57-61) and the part which is not (62-70)
which gives you map(57-61) -> (53-57) and the (62-70) which didnt fall inside the map
continue to next one with both (53-57) and (62-70)
etc



So just do that for all the seed ranges, split when needed, and then choose the smallest one at the end?.
